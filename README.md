# Nested set model

The nested set model is a technique for representing nested sets (also known as trees or hierarchies) in relational
databases.

## Installation

## Tests

If you don't have PHP but you have Docker and Docker Compose on your system, you can run `make install`. It will install
a PHP 7.2 FPM. After the installation you can run `make shell` to connect into the PHP's container.
